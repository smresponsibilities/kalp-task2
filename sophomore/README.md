**(Challenge-2): Sophomore**
# üöÄ Build Your Own NFT System on the Kalp Blockchain


## What is this challenge about?

This challenge is about developing a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) system using the KRC-721 standard on the Kalp blockchain. We will create a smart contract in Go that handles the lifecycle of NFTs, including minting, transferring, and burning tokens. The challenge simulates real-world scenarios where NFTs are used for digital art, collectibles, and other unique assets.

## What will we learn?

**By participating in this challenge, we will:**

- Gain hands-on experience with the Go programming language.
- Understand the KRC-721 standard for NFTs.
- Learn how to develop and deploy smart contracts on the Kalp blockchain.
- Enhance our skills in blockchain development and decentralized applications (dApps).
- Explore the concepts of tokenization and digital asset management.
- Improve our problem-solving and coding abilities in a competitive environment.

## Ready to Get Started?

### Let's understand the KRC-721 first!

Imagine you're playing your favorite online game. You've just unlocked an epic sword that's one-of-a-kind. No one else in the game has this exact sword, and it's got special stats that make it super powerful. Now, wouldn't it be awesome if you could prove that this sword is truly yours, trade it with other players, or even sell it outside the game? That's where KRC-721 comes in.

**KRC-721** is a set of rules (or a standard) on the Kalp blockchain that allows developers to create unique digital items, just like that epic sword. These digital items are called Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Unlike regular game currency or items (which are usually identical and can be swapped 1:1), NFTs are unique. Each one has its own identity and characteristics, making them more like collectibles than regular in-game items.

## Checkpoint 1: üèó NFT Contract Walkthrough

Let's **open the file `krc.go`** and dive deep into the NFT contract.

> üí° Refer to the docs for more detailed info: [Write the Smart Contract](https://docs.kalp.studio/Dev-documentation/Kalp-DLT/Smart-Contract-Write-Test-Deploy-Interact/Write-the-smart-contract/)

### 1. Initializing the Token Contract

The **Initialize** method is the first step in setting up your Kalp-based ERC721 token contract. This method assigns a name and symbol to the token collection, ensuring that these identifiers are consistently used throughout the token's lifecycle.

```go
func (c *TokenERC721Contract) Initialize(ctx kalpsdk.TransactionContextInterface, name string, symbol string) (bool, error) {
    err := ctx.PutStateWithoutKYC(nameKey, []byte(name))
    if err != nil {
        return false, fmt.Errorf("failed to set token name: %v", err)
    }
    err = ctx.PutStateWithoutKYC(symbolKey, []byte(symbol))
    if err != nil {
        return false, fmt.Errorf("failed to set token symbol: %v", err)
    }
    return true, nil
}
```

- **Parameters:**

  - `name (string)`: The human-readable name that designates the token collection, often aligning with its intended use cases or branding.

  - `symbol (string)`: A concise and recognizable symbol that serves as a shorthand identifier for the token collection, typically following conventional naming conventions (e.g., "MTK" or "KALP").

- **Return Values:**

  - `(bool, error)`: A boolean indicating success or failure, and an error object if any issues arise.

### 2. üñ® Minting NFTs

The **MintWithTokenURI** method allows you to create new NFTs in the Kalp ecosystem. This method is crucial for establishing ownership and linking the NFT to its metadata.

```go
func (c *TokenERC721Contract) MintWithTokenURI(ctx kalpsdk.TransactionContextInterface, tokenId string, tokenURI string) (*Nft, error) {
    nft := &Nft{TokenId: tokenId, Owner: /* Owner's identity */, TokenURI: tokenURI}
    nftKey, _ := ctx.CreateCompositeKey(nftPrefix, []string{tokenId})
    nftBytes, _ := json.Marshal(nft)
    ctx.PutStateWithoutKYC(nftKey, nftBytes)
    return nft, nil
}
```

- **Parameters:**

  - `tokenId (string)`: The unique identifier for the NFT.

  - `tokenURI (string)`: A URI pointing to a JSON file with the NFT's metadata.

    **Example JSON Format to store in URI:**

    ```json
    {
      "name": "CryptoArt #1234",
      "description": "A unique piece of digital art from the CryptoArt collection.",
      "image": "https://example.com/images/cryptoart-1234.png",
      "attributes": [
        {
          "trait_type": "Background",

        },
        {
          "trait_type": "Mouth",
          "value": "Smile"
        },
        {
          "trait_type": "Accessory",
          "value": "Sunglasses"
        }
      ],
      "external_url": "https://example.com/cryptoart/1234"
    }
    ```

- **Return Values:**

  - `(*Nft, error)`: A pointer to the newly created NFT object and an error object if any issues occur.

### 3. üî• Burning NFTs

The **Burn** method is used to permanently remove an NFT from the Kalp ecosystem, effectively destroying the token and revoking its ownership.

```go
func (c *TokenERC721Contract) Burn(ctx kalpsdk.TransactionContextInterface, tokenId string) (bool, error) {
    nftKey, _ := ctx.CreateCompositeKey(nftPrefix, []string{tokenId})

## Checkpoint 3: üïπÔ∏è Interact with Smart Contract

Now that we've deployed our NFT smart contract on the Kalp blockchain, it's time to interact with it. We'll perform the following actions:

#### 1. **Initialize Contract**

The `initialize` function sets up your NFT contract by assigning a name and symbol to your token collection.
#### 2. **Token Minting**

The `MintWithTokenURI` function allows you to create a new NFT by assigning a unique `tokenId` and associating it with metadata via a `tokenURI`.
#### 3. **Read the Name of NFT**

You can retrieve the name of your NFT collection using the `Name` function.
#### 4. **Burn**

The `Burn` function allows you to permanently remove an NFT from the blockchain.

To interact with the smart contract, we'll use Postman to send HTTP requests to the API endpoints generated by Kalp Studio after deployment.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

1. **[Download Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)**
2. **API Endpoint and API Key**: Obtained from the Kalp Studio after deploying your smart contract.
3. **Smart Contract Functions and Parameters**: Access to the routes and parameters for your smart contract functions, available under **Check Params** in Kalp Studio.

> üí° For a more descriptive deployment guide, please refer to the [Interacting with Smart Contract](https://doc.kalp.studio/Dev-documentation/Kalp-DLT/Smart-Contract-Write-Test-Deploy-Interact/Interacting-with-smart-contract/)

---

### Tips for Using Postman with Kalp Studio APIs

- **Ensure Correct HTTP Methods:** Pay attention to whether the API endpoint requires a GET or POST request.
- **Authentication:** Always include the `x-api` header with your API Key for authentication.
- **Content-Type Header:** When sending JSON data in the body, ensure the `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json`. Postman usually sets this automatically when you select **raw** and **JSON** in the Body tab.
- **Error Handling:** If you receive an error, check the response message for details. Common issues include missing parameters or invalid authentication.

---

> üí° **Note:** Always keep your API Key secure. Do not share it publicly or commit it to version control systems.

If you encounter any issues or need more detailed explanations, refer to the [Kalp Studio Documentation](https://doc.kalp.studio) or seek support from the Kalp community.
